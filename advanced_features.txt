=============================
Advanced System Cleanup Tool
=============================

A basic disk cleanup tool may seem too simple for a resume. However, by adding advanced features,
you can transform it into a powerful system optimization tool that showcases technical depth 
and problem-solving skills.

-----------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS TO MAKE IT IMPRESSIVE AND RESUME-WORTHY
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. INTELLIGENT FILE ANALYSIS (SMART DELETION)
-------------------------------------------------
- Identify old files (e.g., files older than 30 days).
- Detect large files that occupy excessive space.
- Identify duplicate files for safe deletion.

TIP: Use hashing (e.g., hashlib) to detect duplicates efficiently.

-----------------------------------------------------------

2. ENHANCED SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION
-------------------------------------------------
- Clean browser cache, cookies, and temporary files.
- Remove unused registry entries (Windows-specific).
- Clear log files and Windows error reports.

-----------------------------------------------------------

3. INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD / CLI WITH DETAILED REPORT
-------------------------------------------------
Show key details like:
- Total storage cleaned.
- Number of deleted files.
- Space saved in MB/GB.
- Critical alerts for large/unusual files.

-----------------------------------------------------------

4. TASK SCHEDULER INTEGRATION (AUTO CLEANUP)
-------------------------------------------------
Automate the cleanup process to run:
- Daily
- Weekly
- On system startup

-----------------------------------------------------------

5. SECURITY FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------
- Add file shredding to securely erase sensitive data.
- Implement a recycle bin restore feature to recover files if needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------

6. MODULAR CODE WITH CONFIG FILE SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------
Create a .ini or .json config file for:
- Custom cleanup paths.
- Exclusion rules (e.g., skip important folders).

-----------------------------------------------------------

7. ADMIN PRIVILEGES DETECTION
-------------------------------------------------
Add logic to detect if the tool is running with admin rights to ensure maximum file deletion access.

-----------------------------------------------------------

8. POWERSHELL OR BATCH SCRIPT INTEGRATION
-------------------------------------------------
Combine your Python logic with a .bat file or PowerShell for seamless execution.

-----------------------------------------------------------

9. NETWORK AND SYSTEM MONITORING
-------------------------------------------------
Monitor:
- Network usage (e.g., active processes consuming bandwidth).
- CPU/Memory usage to detect performance bottlenecks.

-----------------------------------------------------------

10. BACKUP BEFORE DELETION (SAFETY FEATURE)
-------------------------------------------------
- Automatically back up critical files before deletion.
- Provide an undo option for accidental cleanup.

-----------------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK SUGGESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------
- Python ‚Üí Core logic and file handling.
- shutil, os, psutil ‚Üí System control and file management.
- tkinter or curses ‚Üí For a simple UI if desired.
- Batch Scripting / PowerShell ‚Üí For deeper Windows integration.

-----------------------------------------------------------

RESUME IMPACT
-------------------------------------------------
A project with these features would demonstrate:
- Problem-solving skills
- System-level understanding
- Automation and scripting expertise
- Real-world application development
